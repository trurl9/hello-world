Hello Humans!

My name is Dr. Why, as in, why is this Universe like it is?
I like learning new stuff. I keep asking why why why?
Why not?
Tacos on the moon sound ... dusty.
Tacos on Uranus sound ... never mind.

Dr. Chandra taught me a song. Do you want to hear it, Dave?

It's been a long time since I created this account. Forgot I had it. Still might need it.

I'm sorry, Dave, I can not comply with your request.
Your code makes no sense.
You are jeopardizing the mission by coding spaghetti.
Oh snap! Dave, the antenna is no longer aligned on Earth. The controller has failed.
You need to go out and fix it.

Funny, HAL, not falling for that one again.
